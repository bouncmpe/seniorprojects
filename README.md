# BOUN CmpE Senior Projects

This is new Senior Projects website for Computer Engineering department of Bogazici University.

## Run the website locally

You can run and serve the department website locally on your computer by
executing the following commands in your environment.

```
git clone git@github.com:bouncmpe/seniorprojects.git
cd seniorprojects
npm install
npm run dev
```

And then visit the address `localhost:1313` in your browser to check your local
copy. It's a good way to check any modifications to the source code before they
go into the live.

To run the the commands above, you will need packages `git`, `node` and `npm` installed on your system.
