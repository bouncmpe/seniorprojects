In this project, you will work on cloud-native development and deployment of robotic applications. As the case study, we will use the Autoware repository (https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) and apply cloud-native concepts and tools to build, test, and deploy Autoware in various containerization settings and granularity. You will get practical experience in using Docker, Ansible, and ROS2 tooling.

This project will be closely related to Autoware OpenAD Kit initiative (See https://www.autoware.org/autoware-open-ad-kit).
