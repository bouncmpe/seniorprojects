## Summary
The aim of this project is to build a desktop tool to be used to analyse and visualize Turkish maqam music pieces. This is an engineering project, it does not involve any research. The skills required are python and docker.

## Project Phases
- **Requirements analysis**: Interviewing the stakeholder from ITU Turkish Music Conservatory to understand the needs and desires. Analyzing an existing tool written in an outdated version of Matlab. Surveying the literature for music visualization libraries, frequency analysis libraries, mp3 libraries in python. Documenting and prioritizing the requirements.

- **System design**: Building an architecture that satisfies the requirements.

## Implementation - Testing
- Apart from unit and integration tests, usability and acceptance tests with the stakeholder are required.

## Project Presentation
- This project involves a real stakeholder. I regularly meet with my students and expect them to deliver other artifacts such as requirements specification documents and architectural models as well as the code.
