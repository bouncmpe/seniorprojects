The objective of this project is to create a seamless integration between \[Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/), a high-performance data distribution and storage system, and \[Carla](https://carla.org/), an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. By bridging these two platforms, we aim to enhance the capabilities of autonomous driving systems and facilitate advanced research and development in this field.

## Project Goals

1. Integration: Develop a robust and efficient bridge that allows seamless communication and data exchange between Zenoh and Carla.
2. Data Synchronization: Enable real-time data synchronization between Zenoh's data distribution capabilities and Carla's simulation environment, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for autonomous driving applications.
3. Performance Optimization: Optimize the bridge to ensure minimal latency and high throughput, ensuring efficient data transfer between Zenoh and Carla.
4. Scalability: Design the bridge to be scalable, allowing it to handle large-scale deployments and accommodate future expansion.
5. Documentation and Testing: Provide comprehensive documentation and conduct rigorous testing to ensure the bridge's reliability, stability, and compatibility with different versions of Zenoh and Carla.

## Project Deliverables

1. Zenoh+Carla Bridge: A fully functional bridge that seamlessly integrates Zenoh and Carla, allowing smooth communication and data exchange between the two platforms.
2. Documentation: Detailed documentation on the installation, configuration, and usage of the bridge, along with clear guidelines for developers and users.
3. Performance Report: A report highlighting the achieved performance metrics, including latency, throughput, and scalability, along with recommendations for further optimization.

## Expertise

Strong proficiency in programming languages such as Python and C++ is required. Familiarity with computer networks and containers is desired.
