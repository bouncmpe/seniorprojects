## Summary
In this project, tools will be developed that will collect and analyze transactions from the  widely used  Decentralized Exchange (DEX)  smart contracts on major blockchains (such as Ethereum, Polygon Matic, Hedera, Avalanche and Binance Smart Chain).  The project will develop (i) python based and (ii) web based tools that retrieve and extract transaction data  and analyze it by forming transaction graphs. Various information about transactions, collective movements of crypto assets as well as governance/voting  will be extracted  A web based user interface will also be developed to present the results of the analysis.
