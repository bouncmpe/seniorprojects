## Summary
In this project, you will design and implement a web service to publish senior project offers from faculty to students and disseminate the project results to a wider audience.

## Roadmap
- Requirements collection (talk with your fellow students and faculty)
- Survey of available technologies
- Designing the service according to requirements and available technologies
- Implementation and testing

## Other notes
- A big focus must be placed on maintenance and reliability concerns (hence simplicity is paramount).
- A successful project must be containerized and deployed automatically from the repository via cloud-native tooling.
