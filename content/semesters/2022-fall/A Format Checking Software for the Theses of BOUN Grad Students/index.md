## Summary

BOUN Grad Institute has certain formatting rules for theses. Some of these rules are reflected in the latex template, some aren’t. Students submit their theses in PDF format and a human expert checks these documents against the formatting rules.

The aim of this software is to automatically identify the formatting errors in the PDF document. This can be done in two ways:

The latex source can be parsed and analysed.
The PDF file can be analysed.
The students should implement a combination of the strategies mentioned above, identify and propose fixes for the formatting errors.
