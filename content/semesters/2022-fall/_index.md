This year's Senior Project Poster Sessions were held at the entrance lobby of our department on 16.01.2023 Monday. Throughout the sessions, students, academics and invited industry sector experts wandered around the poster stands, asking questions, and exchanging comments; making it a productive and interactive day for everyone.
