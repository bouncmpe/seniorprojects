title: DeepFake Face Detection System for Face Recognition Systems
type: project
---

In recent years, DeepFake-based realistic facial image synthesis techniques have been used to attack face recognition systems. Non-existent users can be enrolled to face recognition systems, or fake images/videos of existing persons can be generated to fool face verification systems. To prevent such attacks, efficient & accurate fake facial image detection systems should be devised. In this project, we aim to design & implement a DeepFake face detection system.
