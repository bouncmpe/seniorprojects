Stress became the top issue of individuals' life quality. It not only affects the individual's life but affect the whole society. Researchers have demonstrated that 3 out of 4 doctor visits are for stress related ailments  

 and costs the USA about $300 Billion every year in medical bills and lost of productivity.
There are many research studies being conducted in order to detect stress in daily life and try to  

 reduce the stress levels. Recently, wearable devices became popular along with smartphones and the sensors in these devices can be used as detectors of stress.  

 In this project I will introduce the work I conducted in order to detect and identify stress using wearable sensors & phone sensors.
