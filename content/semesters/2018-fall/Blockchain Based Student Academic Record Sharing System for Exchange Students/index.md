title: Blockchain Based Student Academic Record Sharing System for Exchange Students
type: project
---

Universities that participate in exchange programs need to share academic information such as transcripts about the students. Traditionally, this is done by using paper transcripts sealed by university registers. In this project, a permissioned blockchain system is going to be deployed in order to facilitate academic information sharing. Quorum version of Ethereum Blockchain will be used which supports private transactions. Since the system may also be used by Erasmus students, the system will be designed with the new European GDPR  regulation in mind.
