title: Using Deep Learning to Classify Pregnancy Test Results
type: project
---

World Health Organization estimates that there are approximately 36 million people with blindness. It's also estimated that around two thirds of this popu- lation is women, which is approximately 24 million. From discussion made with Bogazici University As- sistance and Education Center for Visually Impaired (GETEM), we have learned that young, visually im- paired women have no private way of taking a preg- nancy test and understanding the result. They ei- ther need to get outside help, be it a friend, family, or spouse, or they need to visit a hospital. While this might sound like a trivial problem to many, this information is extremely private and important to visually impaired women, and people with such dis- abilities have the right to easily access this informa- tion. Firstly discussed idea was to create an em- bedded system with a digital pregnancy test, that'd read out the result for the user. While this would be more usable, it would not be accessible enough - the visually impaired might not be able to cover the cost of such a device, since the production cost would be much higher than an ordinary test.
