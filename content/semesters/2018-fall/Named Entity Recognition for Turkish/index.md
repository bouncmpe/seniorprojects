title: Named Entity Recognition for Turkish
type: project
---

In this study, we implemented a Named Entity Recognition tool for Turkish language. Named entity recognition is a NLP sub-task that is concerned with finding and classifiying named entities which are pre-defined types such as person, location, organization, date, time, money, percentage etc. For morphologically complex languages like Turkish, the task poses a more difficult problem. In our project, we decided to study the existing systems for Turkish and try to improve the results for named entity recognition in formal Turkish texts with a neural network based approach.
