title: Effects of Obstcle in Axelrod's Culturel Model
type: project
---

There are a lot of different races, a lot of countries and communities of people in the world.  it was thought that the small communities had taken under the large communities were assimilated and compared to the big societies. Each community maintains its unique characteristics. And they take property from other societies to the extent they allow. In some societies there are completely obstacles. These obstacles lead to the complete elimination of cultural, social, environmental or religious transitions. In this Project, I tried to work on effects of obstcle in Axelrod’s culturel model.
