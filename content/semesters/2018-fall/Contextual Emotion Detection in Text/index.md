title: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text
type: project
---

With the increase in the ease of use of technology, we communicate more and more with the computers in a conversational way. Such as personal assistants in our phones, automated e-mail responders or online chatbots. To be able to communicate with us effectively computers have to understand our emotions too. However, understanding the emotion by just looking at a single message is not always enough. So, in this project, I studied the ways of detecting the emotion of a text message in the context of former messages, using rule based, learning based and hybrid methods.
