title: An Analysis of the Grand National Assembly of Turkish Parliamentary (TBMM)
  Transcripts
type: project
---

Decisions taken in parliament in the world affect societies and countries. These writings in parliaments are an important and significant resource for social scientists and political scientists. Most countries in the world publish their own parliamentary documents. However,these transcripts are not sufficiently understood by the public. It is the duty of linguists and NLP researchers to ensure that this resource is understandable. A study was carried out that collected all minutes of the Grand National Assembly of Turkish Parliament (TBMM) between 1920 and 20151. In this study, two different languages were used with the change of time in the corpus. One is old Ottoman Turkish and the other one is modern Turkish. In this ongoing study, speaking and changing the linguistic language according to years will be examined by using NLP.
