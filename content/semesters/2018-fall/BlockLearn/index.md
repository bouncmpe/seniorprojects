Since its introduction with Nakamoto’s famous Bitcoin paper, the concept of blockchain has been gaining attraction all over the world. While development of new technologies is becoming more of an issue, teaching how to use them in an effective way provides new opportunities and challenges. Blockchain technologies has their own understanding in the manner of learning and teaching. Therefore teaching blockchain concept and programming requires innovative approach in order to reach better learning experience.   

 A novel approach named MicroCycled Educational Framework is proposed within the scope of this project. For realizing and testing this framework, an interactive blockchain training application will be developed. This application will provide users with interactive slide decks, flexible learning paths and simple programming environment. Interactive approach will allow users to see the structural and organizational details of blockchain mechanisms in more agile ways. Programming environment will help users to become a blockchain developer. Through their agile learning paths, users will be able to gain fundamental insights about each blockchain concepts.
