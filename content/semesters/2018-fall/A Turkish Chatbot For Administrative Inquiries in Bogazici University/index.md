Chatbots have become a popular communication tool with the recent improvements in NLP and machine learning techniques. We observed that every year same questions about regulations are asked over and over among the student groups. In our project we aimed to build a chatbot which answers to most frequently asked questions regarding rules and regulations of Bogazici University. We used Naive Bayes and Deep Neural Network as models to train our program with questions asked in previous years. In order to make our chatbot easily accessible we used a popular messaging platform, Telegram.
