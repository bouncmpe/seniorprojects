Engineering biological systems offers huge benefits to bio economy, through the development of applications in the areas of drug delivery, bio remediation, signaling and so on. Several initiatives have already demonstrated the usefulness of signaling projects in different but interrelated fields including synthetic biology, molecular communications and nanotechnology in order to carry data using living systems. We then use a synthetic biology approach to control cellular response. This approach is key to develop predictable molecular communications channels and is a step towards developing.
