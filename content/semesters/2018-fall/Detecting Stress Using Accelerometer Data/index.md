title: Detecting Stress Using Accelerometer Data
type: project
---

Stress becomes a major issue in public health systems. It is known to be the reason for many diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate stress from life. The very first step of eliminating the stress is detecting it. Smartphones and wristbands include some sensors that measure physiological data such as accelerometer, electrodermal activity and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Our study aims to reveal whether using accelerometer data impacts the overall result of detecting stress.
