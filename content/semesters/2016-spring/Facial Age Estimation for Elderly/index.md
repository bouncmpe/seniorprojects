type: project
---

Age estimation is one research field of face analysis. Image-based age estimation can be defined as determination of a person's age from facial images. Estimating the age of the elderly from the images attempt came up from the interesting approach of the doctors of Alzheimer’s patients. It seems like most of the Alzheimer’s patients look younger than their actual age according to doctors’ observations. Until today, video data has been gathered from up to 20 people, each one older than the age of 65. Since the existing data sets do not consist of large number of elderly population, the data collected is valuable for the improvement of this study. In this study, basic extreme learning machine is used for regression along with LBP, HOG, CNN visual descriptors on the aligned images obtained from various resources.
