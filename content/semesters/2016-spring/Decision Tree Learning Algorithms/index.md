title: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms
type: project
---

We worked with different algorithms: C4.5, Linear Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron and most importantly Soft Decision Trees and Budding Trees. Last two were proposed by our Advisor Prof. Ethem Alpaydın and his former student Ozan İrsoy. We implemented all of them and tested on different large data sets to see the potential of those trees. We tried to understand the learning process through different methods. Our aim was to spot weak points of those algorithms and propose new models based on those. We list many results and visuals on large data sets. Furthermore, we propose new models and we list their comparisons with base models.
