title: An interactive tool to visualize Nazım Hikmet's poetry
type: project
---

Digital Humanities is an area where computing and humanistic disciplines intersect. In this project, we intersect literature with computing by visualizing Nazım Hikmet’s poetry. We developed a visualization tool to explore the distinctive style of Nazım Hikmet, to examine the changes in his style over the years, and to enable scholars to query aspects of his oeuvre selectively. We combined text-mining methodologies and interactive visualizations for this purpose. A database is created from Nazım’s entire work to store and query both content and structure. We parsed the content,  

 applied NLP methods including sentiment analysis and made the information available to querying and visualization. We developed a generic tool and a web interface, which can potentially be adopted for other artists.
