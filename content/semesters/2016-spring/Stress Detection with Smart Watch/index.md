title: Stress Detection with Smart Watch
type: project
---

In this project, we found correlation between heart rate, physical activity and stress level. We collect sensor data for stress level from the user. In addition, user gives us input from the watch about the instant stress he or she experiences, arousal and valence values. We process the raw data and come up with statistics and graphs for each user. Then, with knn algorithm on Matlab, we find accuracy percentages for each individual subject. By analyzing all inputs we get from the user with the heart rate data, we create groups of subjects as classification. We checked each group  

 individually and find acceptance percentages for them as well. This way, we try to comment on the correspondence between heart rate and stress level seen on the people.
