Project is about creating a Virtual Reality work environment, in which player can enhance their abilities. With today’s technology it is possible to make realistic virtual worlds, so using this we can improve people’s abilities and decision making mechanisms in various situations. Starting a job without any experience can lead to psychological pressure, with this project we are aiming to reduce this anxiety and stress by creating a similar environment where user will work. In order to make it more realistic we are planning to use no traditional controllers, such as keyboard, mouse or console controller. Player will be able to control his/her environment with gestures like stepping or arm thrusting. Project will not cover a full in-depth game, its main focus is creating the tools necessary and presenting a simple game, where these tools are used.
