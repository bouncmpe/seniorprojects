Beta lactamase antibiotics are one of the widely used antibiotics in the world. They constitute most of the worldwide antibiotic usage and used for bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance of bacterial organisms is an important health issue if we think about today’s world. Our aim is to check all the information about beta lactamase on the internet and journals, and retrieve all data to create our database system which you can easily search proteins, inhibitors and ligands that are related to beta lactamase enzymes.
