title: Efficient Kernel Space Capture and Processing of Thermal Video
type: project
---

Visible light constitutes a small fraction of electromagnetic spectrum. While visible light photography can capture a moment as the human eyes see it, hidden details can be revealed by using other imaging techniques such as thermography. In this project, we developed an estimator framework which includes a thermal camera driver and a system to run estimators on captured thermal  video.
