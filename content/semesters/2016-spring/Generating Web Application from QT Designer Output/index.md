title: Generating Web Application from QT Designer Output
type: project
---

In this project our aim is to develop a software application which targets to generate a web application from a User Interface (UI) file generated by the Qt Creator’s Designer. In that way creating a web application using only user friendly environment of Qt Designer will be possible. We worked on such software and at the end we were able to create a functional proof of concept application. UI file created by Qt does not provide information for methods defined in UI file; functions are defined in cpp code. Therefore for such implementation, whole project of Qt should be taken into account. Still we successfully created software that transforms UI file into Html code in the format required, the file we created can be used as a start point template to create a web application, which significantly reduces the work of user. Since we transform all visible units, minor changes and addition functional implementations will be sufficient to create a web application, hence our work shows that a detailed translation including cpp code will be make it possible to produce full web application using only Qt Creator. Since cpp code was out of our scope we claim it would be beneficial to add a future work on translation of those cpp codes to our software.
