title: Privacy Awareness and Violation Checking
type: project
---

Increasing use of social media comes with its privacy issues and enormous data. This opens a new area in data analysis.  

 In our project we build a website in which users can connect with their Facebook accounts and gets their data analyzed in terms of friend engagement, privacy and use frequency.  

 In a limited environment where Facebook strictly forbids to get friend list of a user in their API (Graph API) we managed to infer possible friends analyzing users’ feed data, likes and comments they get. Also we calculate a score to each possible friend regarding their interaction level with the user.  

 Using PriGuard, a tool developed in MAS (MultiAgentSystem Research Group) of Boğaziçi University, we are able to provide a clean web UI where users can check for privacy violations over their past social data. While feeding PriGuard with user’s data we also analyze them to give user delightful statistics about their friends, posts, likes and comments.  

 Hence we provide a fun way to Facebook users to analyze their social data whilst increasing privacy awareness among them.
