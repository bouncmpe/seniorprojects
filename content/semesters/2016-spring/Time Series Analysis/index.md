Time series is anything that you can represent with numbers and extract statistical information. Stochastic Volatility models are the models that the variance itself changes with time. Inspecting and implementing a solution for such models, often faces the problem of unaffordable complexity with the increasing dimensions. In this project we have tried out different models and mixed solution, as well as we have done attempts in order to increase the performance of algorith in higher dimensions.
