title: Analysis of Musical Sounds for Music Information Retrieval
type: project
---

Music is an integral part of human life. We wanted to do a project on music, and we wanted to do something fun. In the first part of our senior project, we try to find the song that user records on his/her phone. We use Fast Fourier Transform, peak finding, hash generation and audio matching with the help of their fingerprints. Next semester, we are going to implement a system that can be used to change the instruments of Turkish Classical Music songs. We think it would be fun to change Kanun to Electric Guitar or Ney to Saxophone.
