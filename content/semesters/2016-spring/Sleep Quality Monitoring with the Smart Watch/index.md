title: Sleep Quality Monitoring with the Smart Watch
type: project
---

Our objective for the project is to detect physical and biological changes occurred during the sleep and their relation with the sleep quality. There are different parameters and biological characteristics that affect the sleep quality such as body movements, heart rate, snoring, breathing rate and so on. Hence, for our project, we have used an off-the-shelf smart watch for data collection with its built-in sensors. Using linear regression, we can classify a person’s sleep with up to 80% accuracy.
