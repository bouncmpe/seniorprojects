title: A Hashtag Segmentation System for Turkish
type: project
---

Twitter is one of the most popular social network and microblogging tools worldwide.It is free to use and has over 300 million users totally, and estimated turkish users are over 10 million.Users can send and read messages with limit of 140 characters.These messages are called “tweets”.Tweets can be retweeted by other users or can be saved through using “Like” button.Tweets appear on user’s profile page.On Twitter and many other social microblogging applications, contents may include hashtags to group and categorize them.However hashtags can consist of a word or a combination of words.In this project, I implemented a segmenter of hashtags using Twitter hashtags and tweets.
