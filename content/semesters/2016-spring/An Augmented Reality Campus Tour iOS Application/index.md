title: An Augmented Reality Campus Tour iOS Application
type: project
---

We implemented an augmented reality campus tour application for iPhone. Also, we use some tools to design an 3D view of the campus. First of all we get 2D model of the campus from the “openstreetmap.org”. We get the gps location of each length of buildings and the campus itself in 2D view. By using them, we design the 3D model in CityEngine. In CityEngine, we design each building model one by one. To design more realistic buildings, we use real photos of the building to show walls of buildings in campus. Then, we create shapes of all buildings and pyramid in the  

 center of the campus. The final step of creating 3D model of campus is importing campus 3D model on Unity for using in iOS application because Unity is supported for iOS. For our AR iOS application, we used accelerometer, gyroscope, camera and location services of iPhone and for AR functionality of CameraViewController we used ARToolKit for iPhone. As a result, we implemented working AR Campus Tour application for North Campus, but VR Tour for iOS application need some future work.
