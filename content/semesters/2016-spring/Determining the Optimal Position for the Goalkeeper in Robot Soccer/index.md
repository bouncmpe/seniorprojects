type: project
---

Cerberus is the robot soccer team of Boğaziçi University which competes in RoboCup Standard Platform League since 2001. My task for the graduation project was to develop a software for the goalkeeper which keeps it at an optimum place on the field according to the positions of the ball and other players.
