title: Implementation of a Realtime Pitch Tracker
type: project
---

This project is about implementing a VST plugin that works on a host interface. “The goals of this project are ­ learning the C VST SDK ­ MIDI and Audio Programming ­implementation of algorithms for real time pitch tracking”. A VST(virtual studio plugin) is a plugin that integrates software audio synthesizer and effect plugins using DSP(digital signal processing). A VST works on a DAW(digital audio workstation).


Music is in every part of our lives that helps us perceive the world and express ourselves as emotions. One of the features about musical analysis is the pitch of sounds that helps us differentiate which sound is higher or lower. As human beings we do this intuitively but computers use different algorithms and models to analyze this feature since it is slightly different than frequency only. So this project is about imolementing an algorithm and making it available to use as a plugin for products in market.
