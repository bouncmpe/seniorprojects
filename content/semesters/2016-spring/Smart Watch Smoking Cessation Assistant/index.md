Over the past few years, there has been considerable research effort on the active research area directed towards the prevention of smoking, which has been called the single biggest preventable cause of death in the world. In coming up with a preventive system towards health related issues such as smoking, recent in advances in technology such as smartwatches are promising candidates that can be integrated into such studies to obtain more persistent results.  With this study, the goal is to present the idea of using this technology to come up with an automated ubiquitous system that will make it harder for the user to ignore the risks of smoking and motivate healthy behavior. The study focuses on accelerometer data collected from the Samsung Gear S smartwatch and proposes a training and classification approach using template matching with Dynamic Time Warping and classification with K-Nearest Neighbors. It evaluates the performance of the system and concludes by giving suggestions on further improvements that could be made.
