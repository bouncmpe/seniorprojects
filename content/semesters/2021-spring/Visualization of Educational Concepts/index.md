**Cmpe491/492 Visualization of Educational Concepts in web pages**


Online education becomes an essential learning tool. With HTML5, what one can do with web pages is limitless. Why not use this technology to develop innovative, interactive animations, visualizations in any level starting Grade 1 to higher education? Your imagination is the limit for what can be done.


**A few examples to think about:**


* CS: Interactive visualization of algorithms such as AVL trees in operation.
* CS: Visualization of data structures such as linked list or trees.
* Math Grade 1-5: Conceptualizing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Motion in Physics.
* Calculus: Differentiation, integration, series.
* Geometry: Drawing of triangles.
* You name it

**Requirements**


* HTML + CSS + Javascript.
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
* Gaming/gamification background is a plus.

**Open source policy**


* The end product should be an open source project.
* Your code should be high quality  with documentation  since others will see, use, and possibly extend it.
