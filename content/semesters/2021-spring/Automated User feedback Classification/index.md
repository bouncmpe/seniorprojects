title: Automated User feedback Classification
type: project
---

Large amounts of user feedback is collected from various channels such as social media and app store reviews. It is difficult to analyze this amount of feedback manually.


The goal of this project is to cluster user feedback with their sentiments and common themes and messages using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.


* Does the feedback conveys satisfaction, bug report, feature suggestion, or another feeling?
* Are the users happy with a product? What is the trend?
* What are the common bugs or requested features in user feedback?

The project requires NLP and machine learning skills. It may be taken as a group.
