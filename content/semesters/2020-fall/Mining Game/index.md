**Short Description:**


Deep-sea mining is a mineral retrieval process that takes place on the ocean floor. In this project, you will be developing a **turn-based game** for deep-sea mining.


Game will have two sub-modules: i) map designing and ii) mining/game modules. For the map designing module, game board (sea map) will be designed and bunch of ores/minerals will be probabilistically placed under the sea floor, which is a voxelized (grid-like) world. Moreover, the parameters for the exploration/drill ship (e.g., speed of the ship and speed of the drill action for different soils) will be set with the help of this module. For the turn-based game module, drill ships of the each player will receive commands to go at a coordinate. When they reach the coordinate, they will drill for a given depth, and take a measurement. Each player will plan the next movement (going for a location to drill) according to the past measurements. During the actions game will track the time and success condition for the players in a limited time frame.


After finishing the game development, different algorithms can be developed for effective mining strategies, which can be considered as the next stage of the project.
