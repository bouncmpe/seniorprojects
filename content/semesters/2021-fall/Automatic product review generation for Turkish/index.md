title: Automatic product review generation for Turkish
type: project
---

In this project, we aim at building a system that can automatically generate product reviews in a domain, such as movie reviews or book reviews. Two different approaches will be used. One of the approaches is a pattern-based approach, where the reviews are formed by filling in the slots of predefined patterns. The second one is an encoder-decoder approach, where the reviews will be generated by a deep learning model [1]. In the first part of the project, the literature on automatic review generation will be surveyed. This will be followed by the design and implementation of the review generation models.


This is a 2-semesters project.
