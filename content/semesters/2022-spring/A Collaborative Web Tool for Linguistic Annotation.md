A Web Application for Annotating Dependency Parse Treebanks BoAT (Bogazici University Annotation Tool) [1] is an open-source annotation desktop tool designed for manual annotation of sentences in dependency parse format. It has been developed in the scope of a TÜBİTAK project and was implemented in Python 3. It is used by annotators in several projects to annotate the Turkish treebanks in the UD (Universal Dependencies) framework [2].

In this project you will develop the next version of BoAT as a web application with improved functionality. You will be involved in the design and implementation of this web application. The tool will be python based. Furthermore, this tool will be made publicly available as part of the Natural Language Processing tools developed in our department (as part of a platform that is currently being developed by TABILab of Cmpe and the Linguistics Department). In other words, your work will become a part of a resource offered to the scientific community. Finally, while working on this project you will have the opportunity to work with the team that is building the above mentioned platform.
