The goal of the project is the control IRobot Create with a gamepad controller and drive it. As it is drawn in the designs, we would like to control robot wirelessly. In order to do that, gamepad is connected to computer with bluetooth. The computer is connected to Xbee to transfer data to its pair, which is connected to the board. Therefore, the communication between computer and board is wireless also. In addition, the communication between computer and board is ensured by the protocol FIRTD which will be designed by me. Finally, the board sends commands to the robot via open-interface which is prepared by the creators of the robot.
