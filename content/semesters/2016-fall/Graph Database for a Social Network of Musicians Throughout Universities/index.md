title: Graph Database for a Social Network of Musicians Throughout Universities
type: project
---

In this project it is aimed to design a graph database and queries for a social network of musicians and bands from different universities. The database is designed so that the recommendation queries run quickly and the system is not overloaded with endless node scans and cartesian products of sets for joining tables in contrast to relational databases. The properties of graph database are exploited to achieve this performance improvement. The recommendation queries enable students, who are not member of any band and looks for one to be part of, to find bands in their university according to their musical preferences and instrumental choice. Students who are willing to buy or sell instruments and take or teach instrument lessons are also helped to find the options in their university, or city if there is none in their school. Furthermore discovery queries are also run to introduce bands to students that play the genre in students’ taste of music and students of same area of musical interest are matched in order to bring people with similar musical tastes together. Bands are not forgotten as well: To any band which looks for members with specified instruments in specified universities, users who are not a member of any band and can play the desired instrument are recommended. In this part of the report recommendation queries are mostly mentioned, but in the following chapters the design of the nodes, relationships and properties and the queries that generate all of them will also be explained in detail besides the recommendation queries.
