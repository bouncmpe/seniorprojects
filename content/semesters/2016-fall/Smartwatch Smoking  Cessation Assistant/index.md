type: project

Our aim is to detect if the user is smoking correctly, so that they will be encouraged to quit smoking in the future by supplying convincing, user-specific advises to them. Currently, we an smartwatch application which could detect the smoking gestures and gives the number of cigarettes smoked. In the future, the convincing content and user-specific feedbacks could be added to the system.
