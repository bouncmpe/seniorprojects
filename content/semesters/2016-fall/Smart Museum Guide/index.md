It may be hard to visit all artworks in a museum due to the gigantic size of it. Our aim is to create a system that helps visitors of such museums by providing them a guidance at the intersection points of the rooms based on the context of the visitor by using argumentation of the paintings. We construct a multi-agent system so that each painting can express his arguments in a logical representation.
