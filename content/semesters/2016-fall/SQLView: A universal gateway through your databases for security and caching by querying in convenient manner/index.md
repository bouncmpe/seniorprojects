SQLView is a tool which helps to query in more convenient manner and increase efficiency of DB, provides security options. By using this program, people who do not know sql can create and run queries on a SQL DB, also see the results in readable way. Moreover, caching results of pre-defined queries will increase efficiency and security options will help to increase usability of program.  

 We observe decreases in query response times because SQLView runs queries in background periodically. Users who do not know SQL language can easily write their queries using our GUI tool. Also column based privileges secures sensitive data from users in hierarchical manner.
