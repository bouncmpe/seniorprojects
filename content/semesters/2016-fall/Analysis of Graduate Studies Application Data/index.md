type: project
---

Free formatted and non-standardized data can be a problem when it comes to process and extract information. Free format can contain misspellings, different representation of same attribute, non-comparable and heterogeneous data. This paper mainly focuses on analysis of graduate studies data which requires cleaning and correcting using “keyword detection” and standardization. Analysis is done by grouping candidates according to some criteria which can be dynamically decided by user. Pattern recognition; instance matching, translation and conversion and clustering methods are used.
