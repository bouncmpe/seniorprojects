title: Autoencoder Neural Networks
type: project

Deep neural networks have had huge success in recent years. However training them efficiently is still a research area. In this project we investigated a type of neural network, autoencoder, and its variations. Autoencoder is an ANN that tries to reconstruct its input as output. While doing this, it learns features of data as a byproduct. It is also used as a pre-training tool for deep neural networks.
