Nanonetworking is a new communication paradigm in computer networks, which gained interest in last decade. Nanonetworks differ from traditional computer networks in terms of communication characteristics. Therefore, new approaches are presented which needs testing and simulation. Current simulators are of course capable of simulating molecular world but they are not in the context of nanonetworking. Hence in this area, a need for a simulation toolbox has arisen. In this project, we designed a customizable simulation environment whose main functionality targets nanonetworking systems, which users can freely design and test their setup, using general purpose GPU programming facilities with high parallelization capability.
