title: A web-based database for protein-ligand interactions
type: project
---

This project is related to protein-ligand interactions which are important for drug design studies. In this project, the team has coded different scripts which can be used for data extraction, network construction of protein-protein interactions. For these scripts, a user-friendly website has to be created for data extraction and network construction of protein-protein interactions by using protein-ligand interactions for a selected protein family. Designing such a website is so beneficial for the users who do not have any programming skills. Analysing a protein family regarding to their protein-ligand interactions highlights the possible drug candidates.
