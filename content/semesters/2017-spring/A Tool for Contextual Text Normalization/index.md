title: A Tool for Contextual Text Normalization
type: project
---

Social media is growing rapidly for the last years. As of January 2017 Facebook has more than 1.8 billion users and Twitter is being actively used by more than 300 million users. Without a doubt this many users will create their own short language(slang) and they will have their versions of some words. For someone new in any social media application, it might be hard to understand context because of the language being used. One of our goal is to help people understand social media language. So we are creating this tool to text normalization specific to social media texts.
