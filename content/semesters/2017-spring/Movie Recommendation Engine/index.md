Recommendation system's main goal is to provide decent special suggestions to users about their interest according to their taste and profile. Many traditional methods that have been used in recommender systems for decades are nowadays almost outdated and not optimal for the desired high pace of growth in the industry today. The purpose of this report is to evaluate these methods such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and explain recent methods. With the final version of our research project, we will be able to develop a recommender system that meets today's needs.
