title: 3D reconstruction of medical objects
type: project
---

By 3D reconstruction of medical object technique, we can use  computer graphics, image processing, computer vision and  human-computer interaction techniques to reconstruct 3D stereoscopic  image from the given 2D medical images (such as MRI, CT, etc.), and  covert it to 2D or 3D images. Currently, medical image 3D works is  very common business, and it helps mostly the doctors and scientists  to research and study the medical images with more details. In my paper, I want to emphasize the key techniques in the medical  image 3D visualization and designs a system of the medical image 3D  visualization based on VTK and ITK.
