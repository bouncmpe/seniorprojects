Nao Robot Avatar project is implementation of a system that enables seeing from NAO's eyes and moving with NAO's body. NAO's motions will be copied through utilizing an adapted whole-body tracking system and the robot camera images will be displayed on a head mounted display system. For whole-body tracking system, Kinect device, Robot Operating System and openni tracker are used. To get the vision from NAO's perspective, a 3D recording device is designed by using two webcams and placed on the head of the NAO. For head mount display system, a simple virtual reality box is used and webcam screens are mirrored from computer by using Duet display.
