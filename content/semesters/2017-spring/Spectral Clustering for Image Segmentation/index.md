title: Spectral Clustering for Image Segmentation
type: project
---

In the last decade, spectral clustering has become a very active area of research in the machine learning community, with many extensions and applications of the algorithm being developed. One of the more popular applications of spectral clustering algorithms is image segmentation.  Image segmentation plays a fundamental role in computer vision as a requisite step in such tasks as object detection or tracking.
