Engineering systems are designed to perform their functions at high quality and most efficiency. However, it is impossible to develop a system that never encounters a problem in a system life. Hence, reliability is a key issue for engineering products. Predictive maintenance plays a crucial role to sustain a product in stable and good operating conditions.Identification of change points and outliers may give important information about condition of the system. Also, it provides more accurate tracking. Furthermore, online solutions enable us to prevent machines from failure or harmful situations.
