Annotation is way of associating information with resources. Recently, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published annotation data model[23 February 2017]. Purpose of this project was to find a use case for  

 annotation data model. The use case was Crowdmap. CrowdMap is an application that allows users to collaboratively add meta information or relations between subjects. It is reminiscent of the detective walls with pictures of suspects and maps that are annotated via detectives.
