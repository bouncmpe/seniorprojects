type: project
---

Information is one of the most valuable asset in twenty-first century. While the importance of information increases, the need to preserve personal privacy is becoming essential. In the context of Internet of Things, the sensory data about our life and our surrounding is sending to the internet, which is vulnerable to violate personal privacy. In order to preserve the privacy in the context of Internet of Things, specifically in the autonomous smart traffic, we implemented a communication protocol that auctions privacy while managing intersections for an autonomous multi-agent traffic.
