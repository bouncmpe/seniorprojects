Scheduling is a fundamental issue that comes up in many different application areas and needs to be solved in the most optimal way possible given the problem parameters. MS and PhD application process in universities is no  

 exception. This study focuses on interview scheduling with a group of applicant students and university instructors based on a custom algorithm that avoids any conflict and makes exceptions for each instructor availabilities. It  

 particularly follows the conventions of Boğaziçi University and Computer Engineering Department for the task at hand, but it can be modified for any department, university or even other scheduling tasks.
