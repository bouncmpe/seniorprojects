ISPs today offer 100 Mbps to modems, but people never seem to get that through their WiFi. About half of the 10-20% ISP churn is due to performance dissatisfaction, and the leading cause of that is poor WiFi. This costs an ISP like Comcast a billion dollars each year. They desperately need to own home WiFi the way they do the rest of their network, yet all the new technology being built is for “faster” WiFi, not “controlled” WiFi. Today numerous devices connect to internet via wifi. Most of the consumer products do not even have ethernet jack. As the internet speeds increase, wifi becomes bottleneck for most users. Especially users living in larger houses need multiple access points for better usage. Because home wifi networks poorly managed, users encounter problems. These wireless problems that users experience could stem from various sources. To deal with these, we have implemented intelligent cloud system that aggregates and analyzes the data from home wifi systems for solving their problems.
