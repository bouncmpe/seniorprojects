The aim of this project is to integrate existing speech processing and synthesis tools to communication with the Baxter robot. English and Turkish languages will be used in communications, in setting tasks or in getting information from the robot. The robot's voice based communication skills will be reinforced with various interfaces including emotions displayed on the tablet and gestures of the robot.
