5G is an expected enabler for autonomous vehicles. Ultra fast and tactile Internet provided by 5G will let autonomous cars to execute their code and algorithms with the help of RSU (Road Side Unit) and MEC (Mobile Edge Computing). In this project, you are expected to tackle with the following research questions: i) Obtain the realistic spatio-temporal behavior of vehicles in an urban setting. ii) Characterize both the networking and the computaional load on the 5G edge network due to intelligent connected vehicles. iii) Use ML techniques to carry out predictive analysis. For the mobility part of the project, SUMO is an ideal tool. SUMO is an open source, highly portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks. For assessing the networking and computational load, you will use EdgeCloudSim which is developed in our lab.
