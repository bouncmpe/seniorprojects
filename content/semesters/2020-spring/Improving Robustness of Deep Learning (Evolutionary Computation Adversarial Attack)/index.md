title: Improving Robustness of Deep Learning (Evolutionary Computation Adversarial
  Attack)
type: project
---

We propose a new Adversarial Attack combining Projected Gradient Descent and Evolutionary Computation. Our experiments show the method improves the baseline and it achieves near state-of-the-art.
