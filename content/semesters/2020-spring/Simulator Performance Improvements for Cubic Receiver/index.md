title: Simulator Performance Improvements for Cubic Receiver
type: project
---

Molecular communication is relatively new research field that is inspired from biological cell communication. The research activities in this field is generally related to the simulations to observe and study the results of the models. The main problem of the current simulation studies are the time complexity. In this project, we introduce an optimized diffusion simulation for a specific receiver type in Matlab programming environment. After some tests that are verified with KS-Test, results show that it is possible to reduce the time of simulation approximately 8% with optimized simulator for a cubic receiver.
