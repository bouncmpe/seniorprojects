Mobile Test Automation Framework is a project that aims to automate the testing process for mobile applications by collecting data based on real-world usages and then by feeding this collected data to a test generation engine that is based on machine learning. The projects consist of two sub-projects. The first sub-project is responsible for the collection of data. In order to do that, a library will be provided for mobile platforms and this library will record user sessions on a per-event basis and in such manner that the same session can be reproduced via these recorded logs. The project is interested in sessions that have crashed or encountered an error. Thus, with the first project, there will be data about failed sessions, and also with this data, these failures can be reproduced for further examination. The second sub-project will utilize the obtained data in order to generate tests that target real-world usage scenarios. The purpose of the project is to automate testing for mobile applications and having better-targeted tests. This paper will focus on the first sub-project which is the collection of session data and the reproduction of these sessions.
