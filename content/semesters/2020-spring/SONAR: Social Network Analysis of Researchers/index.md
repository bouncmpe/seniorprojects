title: 'SONAR: Social Network Analysis of Researchers'
type: project
---

SONAR aims to identify the key researchers in a domain of study through creating and analyzing author-centric social networks. Each node in the network represents an author along with her/his attributes. The relations are based on co-authorship on peer evaluated publications. Co-author networks filtered according to various social network analysis (SNA) metrics (eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality) reveal interesting characteristics of the authors as well as the research domain.
