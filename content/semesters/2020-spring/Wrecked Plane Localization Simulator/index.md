Molecular communication is drawing attention recently, and it has its own benefits compared to other methods. We constructed our project around the idea of using molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) for disaster recovery scenarios especially for locating wrecked planes. The idea is that we assume that a source leaks a certain kind of molecule and agents that can detect that molecule try to reach the source successfully. In order to test the feasibility of our idea, we developed a simulation environment that is capable of applying MCvD techniques for localization applications. We came up with three algorithms and analyzed whether, under certain conditions, they can help agents find the source successfully or not.
