title: Turkish – English Machine Translation System
type: project
---

We organized a Turkish-English parallel corpus that can be used with machine translation applications. A corpus means a large collection of text produced by real users. A parallel corpus is a collection of two corpora, in a way that one is the translation of the other, and texts are aligned. After organizing part of the corpus, we created a statistical machine translation system, using an existing tool, Moses. We tried to improve our machine translation system by trying to train the system with different sized corpora or processing the training data in different ways.
