type: project
---

Transcriptomics field studies human transcriptome, in other words human RNA. RNA is related to gene expression. In this project we analyze mus musculus on 3 different diets and generate results for gene expression and effects of this gene expression on biological pathways and gene sets from raw transcript data which is ~40GB. We use kallisto for quantification, deseq2 for Differential Expression Analysis, piano for Functional Analysis.
