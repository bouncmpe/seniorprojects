Security cam project aims to make homes safer and check the people who rings the bell at the door. This project can be used by people through an IOT based mobile application. Users can use many camera systems with a user account and each system can be managed by an admin. If there is a suspicious situation, each member of a camera system is warned by the mobile application even if the member is away from home . In this project we also need a server side to collect data from camera system and control the system from away with mobile application. In order to make the project more useful and more efficient, image processing is also used for training the system everyday. This project consists of three main parts; camera -iot part-, server side, and mobile application.
