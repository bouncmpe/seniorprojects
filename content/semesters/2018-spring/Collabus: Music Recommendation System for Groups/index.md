title: 'Collabus: Music Recommendation System for Groups'
type: project
---

In this decade, the music industry had a paradigm shift to digital distribution through online music stores and music streaming services, like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and SoundCloud. However, with the massive increase of available songs in the platforms, users of those encountered the problem of choosing suitable songs for them. Therefore, music recommendation systems became much more important to guide listeners to explore new songs suitable for their taste.  

 Our greatest motive for this project is developing a music platform that recom- mends songs based on a group of people’s shared preference and taste. Usually, people gather with a purpose to do something together, like dining, chilling or chatting. In the meantime, it has always been hard to select a suitable song for the ambiance and people. A self-deciding music platform would be beneficial for having a better time together.
