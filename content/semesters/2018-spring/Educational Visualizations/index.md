**Educational Visualizations**


**Background.** We have been using teaching.codes in cmpe160 since 2014. You probably used the system. The original content was in pure HTML pages. HTML is good but not easy to maintain in such a system.


**Current system.** We have many pure HTML+CSS pages without interactivity.


**Project.** We want to add some javascript animations/visualizations/simulations in order to increase interactivity, visualizations of the key CS concepts. For example visualizations of AVL tree rotation, pointers in C, link list operations.


**Requirements.** Knowledge of javascript, snap.svg, svg.
