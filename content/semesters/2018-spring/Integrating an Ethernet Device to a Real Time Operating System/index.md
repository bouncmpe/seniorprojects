title: Integrating an Ethernet Device to a Real Time Operating System
type: project
---

This project consists of understanding the capabilities of an ethernet device, learning how to use these capabilities and integrating these capabilities to a Real Time Operating System. We used TMS570LS3137, a microcontroller that is manufactured by Texas Instruments. We integrated the driver on GIS operating system, which is a real time operating system developed by TUBITAK-BILGEM. We implemented basic functionality for the device, such as sending packets, receiving packets; then bound these functions to a GIS driver structure. Then registered this driver to the system. We wrote a simple ping application on top of it. We, then, ran tests on the application to measure the stability of the driver.
