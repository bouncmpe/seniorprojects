title: A Named Entity Recognition Tool for Turkish
type: project
---

In this project, it is aimed to implement a named entity recognition tool for Turkish based on the thesis that Hakan Demir conducted in 2014. A named entity recognition tool is a program which seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. Considering it is a morphologically rich language, Turkish texts were tried to be classified. Turkish is considered so since it is an agglutinative and inflectional language. With this tool, it is proposed supervised neural network based approach for NER in morphologically rich languages without making use of any language dependent features.
