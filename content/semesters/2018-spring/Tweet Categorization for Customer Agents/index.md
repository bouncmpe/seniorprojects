type: project
---

I propose a categorization technique for topic modeling in Twitter, which train models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on datasets consisting of tweets and their responses. This categorization technique is designed for the telecommunication companies in this project and aims to increase customer satisfaction.
