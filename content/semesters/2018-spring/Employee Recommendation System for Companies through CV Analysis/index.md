This leads lots of job applicants do applications for wrong job or apply without fully understand what job is s/he applying to. This makes the process of selection of canditates longer than expected, because the irrevelant applications makes a huge burden on Human Resources.  

 The main idea of the project is to create a platform that recommends employees for companies by analyzing candidate person’s informations like working experience, general knowledge about the job, graduated school, computer skills, language etc.
