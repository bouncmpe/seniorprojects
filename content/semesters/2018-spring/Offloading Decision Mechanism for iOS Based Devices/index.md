title: Offloading Decision Mechanism for iOS Based Devices
type: project

Mobile Devices has become more powerful since the first smartphone released. In the beginning, they are just UI tool for fast connection and reachability. However, they are now capable to execute intensive computational tasks. This brings the question, whether the task is executed in a server or not, in mind. In this project, we worked on this problem to find concrete results. Our implementations can divide into two parts, server and devices. In a server, we build a server gives responses to requests from our application. In device part, we build an application that collects the necessary information and displays different case examples such as object detection and matrix multiplication. We will show our decision mechanism algorithm. We compare the results of different circumstances.
