title: SDN Controller Load Balancing
type: project
---

The use of multiple controllers in SDN can be due to performance improvements, scalability, and reliability. That is, traffic can be processed much faster and a fault in one controller can be hidden by another one with multiple controller usage .Â   

 To take advantage of multiple controllers, one can distribute the load on the controllers in such a smart way that SDN does not suffer from high traffic and consequently latency, low bandwidth, and even worse, crashes.
