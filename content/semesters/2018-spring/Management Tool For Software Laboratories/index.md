Dealing with large number of computers sequentially in software laboratories (in terms of maintenance and performing other tasks) is time and energy consuming. Administrator accounts of central computers in laboratories has to be used by everyone to make or change states of computers if any mechanism for role differentiation does not exist. With this tool, computers can be suspended, shutdown, rebooted, and some programs can be enabled/disabled with just one-click concurrently. User roles are adjusted and users cannot go beyond their roles. Classroom addition is also possible. Tool is designed for only Linux platforms.
