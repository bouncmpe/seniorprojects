Communication is an important feature of HCI systems. Speech Emotion Recognition aims to focus on the emotional part of communication. When recognition is based only on voice, emotion recognition is still a challenging issue. Speech Emotion requires a set of operation such as feature extraction, training, and classification. In this paper, i am glad to share these steps of my project. In conclusion, we will be able to see the results for different feature selections and classifiers.
