title: Automatic Differentiation
type: project
---

As the number of computer programs that need the gradient of functions increase, (such as machine learning programs that use gradient descent algorithms) efficient derivation of gradients problem has risen. Many machine learning / deep learning algorithms use derivations at each step. So the efficiency of the derivation matters a lot for those programs. There are three main ways to differentiate a function. On this project, we implemented automatic differentiation which is the most suitable one of these methods for our purpose of use.
