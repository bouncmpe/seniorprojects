title: Compiling a lexicon of Turkish multi-word expressions
type: project
---

A multi-word expression (MWE) is a lexeme (term) made up of a sequence of two or more lexemes that has properties that are not predictable from the properties of the individual lexemes or their normal mode of combination. In short, a MWE is like an idiom. In several languages, there are built-in dictionaries of MWEs. In this project, we aim at forming a dictionary (lexicon) of MWEs for Turkish.


First read the paper “[PARSEME Survey on MWE Resources](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/718_Paper.pdf)”, Losnegaard, G.S., Sangati, F., Escartin, C.P., Savary, A., Bargmann, S. and Monti, J., Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, 2016. This paper is an output of a European project (PARSEME) on MWEs. It explains the methodology and gives a structure for building such lexicons.
