title: Visualization of Time Series Data
type: project
---

In this project, I implemented a visualizing tool for time-series data. The data is read from the csv file and stored as a 3d tensor. This results in application being very memory efficient and fast compared to most other applications. Some of the most recent technologies were used for implementation such as electron, react and chartjs library.
