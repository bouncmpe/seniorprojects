title: Controller Synchronization Algorithm for Distributed SDN Control Mechanism
type: project
---

The main focus of this project is on synchronization of SDN controllers. In a multicontroller structure of SDN, the term synchronization  stands for each controller acknowledging one another about newly generated flow rules and knowledge of topology. In addition, for the case of one controller being down, the other controller has to manage to make the structure under the former controller work as before.
