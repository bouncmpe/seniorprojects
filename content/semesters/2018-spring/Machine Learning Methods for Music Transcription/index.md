title: Machine Learning Methods for Music Transcription
type: project
---

Music transcription is the transformation of a musical signal into either a human-readable, or a machine-readable form. Some trained people could achieve this task, with the help of their education and the human intuition. But it is very challenging to develop an automated transcriber, because we need to teach a machine to. We do not realize it often, but there is great mathematical harmony in music. So if we could figure out the aspects of this mathematics, it would be help us develop new technologies for the  

 analysis and synthesis of music. In this project, I am planning to make research about properties of musical sound signals, and some methods of analyzing them. After a period of learning, implementing a machine learning method of my own would be my next goal.
