Decentralized systems have always been a question and also a chance for humanity. As a decentralized system, blockchain had created an enormous interest in people at the present time. There are many reasons behind this interest, i.e. high price increase in crypto currencies. However from the point of computer science, blockchain is highly valuable software architecture. In our capstone project, we are developing a smart contract that holds currency data from TCMB(The Central Bank of Turkey) and ECB(European Central Bank) in Ethereum blockchain network. Our smart contract keeps all past currency data from these two banks, so people may use these currency data by consuming our smart contract. In this project we want to offer trustable currency data for all people in Ethereum blockchain network with minimum fees. People can retrieve any data from 1999 to until today, can convert currencies in any date between 1999 and today. The reason of the date 1999, TCMB and ECB gives currency data till that date. Our initial focus is Turkish users, however all people in around the world can use our smart contract trustfully.
