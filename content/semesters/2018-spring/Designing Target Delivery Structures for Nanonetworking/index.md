title: Designing Target Delivery Structures for Nanonetworking
type: project
---

Nanonetworking is an emerging technology that attracts significant attention in the research community. Yet, most of the previous work in the literature considers communication within a single pair of nano-machines. The aim of this project is to design mechanisms for transmitting messenger molecules targeting specific destination cells.  

 The project requires some background in biology and urge to explore a new research field. If you are interested in this project, contact Tuna Tuğcu (tugcu@boun.edu.tr).
