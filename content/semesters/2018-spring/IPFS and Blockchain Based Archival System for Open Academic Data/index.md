title: IPFS and Blockchain Based Archival System for Open Academic Data
type: project
---

Open academic data such as course syllabi and degree programs are very valuable and need to be preserved in time stamped fashion. InterPlanery File System (IPFS) can be used for distributed storage of files. Ethereum blokchain based smart contracts can be used to keep time stamped records of academic data  and provide mechanisms for citing such data. A system that consists of  (i) a crawler for  academic data (ii)  file archiver on IPFS  (iii) smart contracts for keeping file records and citations and (iv)  web interface for searching and displaying info about archived data.  The system will be demonstrated by archiving  academic data from  universities in Turkey.
