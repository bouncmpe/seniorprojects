type: project
---

WebAssembly  enables high language programs written in C/C++/Rust to be complied and deployed on  web browsers. In this project, various parallel sorting and numerical algorithms  will be developed and run on web browsers. Their performance will be evaluated by testing and reporting speed-ups obtained.
