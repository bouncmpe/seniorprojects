title: Building a parallel corpus for Turkish-English machine translation
type: project
---

(Cmpe491 only)


In this project, a Turkish-English parallel corpus will be created. We will start by analyzing an already existing corpus. Then, new data will be collected and sentences will be aligned using alignment algorithms. When the corpus is ready, machine translation applications between Turkish and English will be implemented using some existing tools. We will develop a statistical translation and a neural translation system.
