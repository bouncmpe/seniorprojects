---

In this project, relation extraction in Turkish text will be implemented using pattern matching and supervised machine learning techniques. First, the existing literature will be reviewed. Then, a corpus will be collected and the relation types that will be extracted will be identified. This will be followed by developing different types of algorithms for extracting the relations.
