title: Monitoring Parkinsonian Hand Tremor Using Smartwatch
type: project
---

Parkinson's disease is an illness which affects more than 1% of people over 55 while more than 3% of individuals over 75 years old. Its symptom mostly includes extensive tremor.  In order to treat Parkinson disease, it is important to track daily activities of Parkinson patient. In this project, we aimed to implement our own wearable tracking platform on a Smart-watch to be able to detect quantification of Parkinsonian hand tremor.
