Aim of the project allowing people to gain experience in a virtual world before jumping into real world using Virtual Reality technology. Main concern of the project is making this experience as natural as possible. In order to achieve this we don't want to use keyboards, controllers or other control devices; only controller we use is the user’s body itself.
