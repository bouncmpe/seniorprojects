title: Detecting experimental methods for physical interactions in biomedical texts
type: project
---

Our aim is developing a text mining system consisting of BioC-compatible modules integrated together to assist biocurators.We contributed to the system by developing a module for identifying the passages that describe experimental methods for physical PPIs. Our approach is based on tf-rf and word2vec techniques.
