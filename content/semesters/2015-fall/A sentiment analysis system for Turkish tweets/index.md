Sentiment Analysis which is part of Natural Language Processing, means making text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. Sentiment analysis is the most common technique for natural language processing in order to understand human languages. In spite of the fact that sentiment analysis has many sections, we interest on “Sentiment Prediction” by classifying the words as “positive”, “negative” or “neutral”. This is the main aim of our project.
