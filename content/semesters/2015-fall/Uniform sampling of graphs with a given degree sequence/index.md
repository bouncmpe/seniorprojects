title: Uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence
type: project
---

Generating random graphs is an important topic with quite many applications. In this paper we focus on generating directed and undirected graphs from given indegree and outdegree sequences, and use this method to determine whether using only the indegree and outdegree sequences of a biological food network graph is enough to characterize and analyze the graph. As a way of characterizing, we used the clustering coefficient of a graph to map graphs into numbers.
