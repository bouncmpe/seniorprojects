title: Using text analysis to determine the genealogy of Leonardo da Vinici’s manuscripts
type: project
---

Inspired from the manuscripts of Leonardos "Trattato Della Pittura", in this project, we aim to measure and analyse the textual differantiation of several variants of a document and from these measurements, to determine the chronological order and the phylogenetic relations of the copies of a document.
