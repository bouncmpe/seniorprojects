In this proposal, we aim to find salary prediction algorithm. This algorithm recommends the salary range which depends on the experience, sector and department of employee. Machine learning techniques are used for prediction. For the first part of project, we tested linear regression, quadratic regression and knn models with 1, 3 and 5 neighbors. In second  phase, we applied logistic regression.
