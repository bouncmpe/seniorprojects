We address the problem of Part of Speech tagging for noisy texts in Turkish language. The popular social media network Twitter has gained so much attention in Turkey recent years and for this reason we considered Twitter as a perfect candidate for noisy text source for Turkish language and consequently have decided to supply our data set from Twitter. We used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for modeling our problem.We have created a data set in order to train and test our model which constitutes around 500 tweets. Considering the fact that no open-source data and tool has been available for POS tagging task in noisy texts for Turkish language we will make our data and tools available for the research community with a view of enabling further contributions to the problem.
