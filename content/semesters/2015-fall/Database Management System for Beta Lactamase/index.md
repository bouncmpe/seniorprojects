Beta lactamase antibiotics are one of the widely used antibiotics in the world. They constitute over 50% of the worldwide antibiotic usage and used for bacterial infections. So to find and develop better solutions to bacterial infections, we need to study on Beta lactamase and collect all the information. In this project we aim to create a database that has all the information from worldwide about beta lactamases.
