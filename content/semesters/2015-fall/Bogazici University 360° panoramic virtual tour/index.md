Every year after university entrance exams, students struggle to find out which university is the best suitable option for them. It’s not about only the education level but also the social, cultural, economic, environmental choice. Students tends to have more detailed information about the universities in terms of physical environment such as buildings, laboratories or campuses. Thus, we developed a 360° virtual tour so that student candidates and curious people will be able to sight inside Bogazici University.
