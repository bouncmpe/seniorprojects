title: Parallel Matching and graph coloring algorithms
type: project
---

In this project we worked, analyzed and discussed about scalable distributed-memory parallel algorithms for graph coloring and matching. The motivation is that, graph coloring is still known as NP complete problem so there is no known polynomial algorithm for that. However, we can approach the problem as scalable-distributed problem. So we can color the graph with parallel processing.
