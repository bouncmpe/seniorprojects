Most developers are unwilling to spend time on writing a clean code because they want their code to run as soon as possible. For this reason, they immediately want to jump into the coding process. Of course, this is not a good engineering approach; but, let us imagine an ordinary developer and his/her behaviors. Because of their desire to see their creation as soon as possible, they don't have a proper preparation period and they ignore how clean and understandable their code is while trying to have a working implementation. At the first glance, developers may think that they can make their code cleaner once the code is running. However, this is not the case. First of all, after having so many lines of code it is very hard to reshape it without damaging something. Secondly, developers lose their thrill after they have reached their goal by creating a solution from ground.
In the business world, companies don't realize how much money and resources a bad and untidy code costs. For instance, when new employees are hired, sometimes they cannot understand the code written before them, so they choose to start over.
A long-lasting implementation should be clean, readable, less-commented, and understandable in order to give readers the opportunity to understand it without spending too much time and make it easier to build another code from it.
