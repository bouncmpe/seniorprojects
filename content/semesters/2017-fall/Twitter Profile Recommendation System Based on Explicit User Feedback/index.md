title: Twitter Profile Recommendation System Based on Explicit User Feedback
type: project
---

With the rapid development in technology and easy access to information, a community of “makers” emerged. There is a project called Open Maker that aims to bring together the makers and manufacturers in Europe. As a submodule of the project, we developed a Twitter Account Recommendation System based on explicit user feedback. Since our setting was rather unique, we used several methods to improve the prediction performance, compared the results and assessed possible shortcomings.
