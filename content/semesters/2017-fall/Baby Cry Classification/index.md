title: Baby Cry Classification
type: project
---

Crying is the first oral communication of babies. Babies express their feelings by crying before they learn how to express their feelings. They express their feelings of hunger, sleepy or pain by crying. Sometimes, however, it's hard to find out why a baby cries. This can certainly be frustrating or frightening for a caregiver, so we designed a baby crying classification system to categorize baby crying in this project. With this project we helped parents and nurses meet the needs of babies. At this moment, we have identified five different baby senses: hunger, pain, sleepy, scared and discomfort. We found fifteen features of the voices and we put the voice we want to test into a category based on these characteristics. The directed acyclic graph support vector machine is ultimately used to classify the baby crying. Experimental results are good. Performance and classification accuracy of the proposed system is up to 80%.
