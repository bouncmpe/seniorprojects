Twitter is a medium that allows information to spread very fast. It is hard to find the source of the informationg and confirm its truth. I have developed a tweet analysis web tool, TweeTrust, to find the first instance of a URL, hashtag or an image to help find the source of the information that is being spread on Twitter. The users can then comment on the validity of the information and share their thoughts. A list of fast spreading local trends also can help find the news on the home page.
