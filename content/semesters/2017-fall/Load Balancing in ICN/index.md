title: Load Balancing in ICN
type: project
---

Information-Centric Networking is still an incomplete paradigm which introduces a large variety of new topics and approaches over the traditional networking. Since it is a relatively new concept which promises for easier and faster data access many aspects of it have been studied intensely in recent years. Nonetheless, load balancing is one of the less focused but high potency, open-ended areas. The aim of this project is to present an alternative technique to load balancing in the domain of pre-suggested routing method LSCR (Link State Content Routing). We suggested multi-path interest and multi-source data packet routing on the bases of Forwarding and Routing Tables of LSCR and packet routing protocol of  Source Routing We developed a simulator software to implement and test the multi-path routing algorithm. Multi-path routing and LSCR were compared with regard to the load of the links and it is concluded that new technique is better at the utilization of overall network links.
