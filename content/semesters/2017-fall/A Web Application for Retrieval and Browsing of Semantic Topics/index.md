title: A Web Application for Retrieval and Browsing of Semantic Topics
type: project
---

In this project, we build a web interface to allow those who are interested and the research community to use SBounTI topic identifier - a product of Ahmet Yildirim's PhD study. SBounTI identifies topics of a set of microblog posts of multiple users. It produces semantic web representations for the identified topics. The topics are expressed using an ontology that defines microblog topics.
