title: Identification of properties of architectures using machine learning techniques
type: project
---

In this *two-terms project*, we aim at identifying some architectural properties of buildings using machine learning techniques. The properties may be the architect of the building, the era of the building, the architectural type of the building, etc. First a number of photographs of the buildings will be compiled. Then they will be analyzed using the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision) library and important features will be extracted. Then a machine learning method (artificial neural network) will be applied to determine the desired properties.
