title: Developing a centroid-based classification model for text categorization
type: project
---

Given a text document and a predetermined set of classes, text classification (categorization) is the task of finding the correct class of the document. Centroid-based classification is a simple type of classification in which the given document is assigned to a class based on the similarity between the document and the centroids of the classes. In this project, we begin with reading the paper “A New Centroid Based Classification Model for Text Categorization”, Liu, C., Wang, W., Tu, G., Xiang, Y. and Konan, M., 2016. (Request the paper from me.) We will simulate this paper, which proposes a new method for centroid-based classification. Then, we will improve this method as suggested is the “future works” part of the paper.
