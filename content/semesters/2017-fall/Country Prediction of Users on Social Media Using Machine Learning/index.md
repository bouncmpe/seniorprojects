title: Country Prediction of Users on Social Media Using Machine Learning
type: project
---

The aim of our project is to predict home country of social media users who do not specify it explicitly. To achieve the goal, we used location information of users who already specified it and approach the problem in a probabilistic manner. In this project, we focused on Twitter users, however the scope may be widened to any other social media platform. The problem can be easily extended to other prediction problems with similar missing information structure.
