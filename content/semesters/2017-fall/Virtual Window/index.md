Virtual Window aims to make 3D computer graphics more intuitive to interact with. It attempts to match the viewing origin with the position of the actual viewerâ€™s eyes in real time, so that the image projected on the screen does not remain static regardless to the movement of the viewer. Instead, with the techniques of this project, the image on the screen changes as if the screen was a see-through window with 3D objects behind.
