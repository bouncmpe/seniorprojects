title: Comparative sentence analysis in Turkish documents
type: project
---

Comparative analysis is the task of identifying comparison sentences in the documents, analyzing the word groups and structures in these sentences, and extracting the compared objects and their properties. For instance, in the comparison sentence “the sound quality of CD player X is better than that of CD player Y”, the objects CD players X and Y are compared and the result of the comparison is that X is better than Y in terms of sound quality. In this project, we aim at doing comparative analysis for Turkish sentences. We will collect a document collection and then develop some methods for analyzing comparative sentences.


Begin with reading the paper “[Identifying Comparative Sentences in Text Documents](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/sigir06-comp.pdf)”, Jindal, N. and Liu, B., SIGIR 2006. We will follow a similar approach in the project, but for Turkish.
