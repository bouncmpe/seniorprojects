title: Channel Selection Schemes by Estimating Side Channel Interference
type: project
---

Wi-Fi standard on 2.4Ghz ISM band specifies 22MHz wide channels seperated by 5MHz increments. With this scheme adjacent channels overlap and devices operating on adjacent channels interfere with each other. Side channel interference results in a drop on communication rates and reduces the Wi-Fi performance. Most of the time it's not possible to find out which channel the interference is coming from. In test environments we have generated Wi-Fi traffic on all adjacent channels and made observations on the impacts of each adjacent channel. We present our findings which could be used for smart channel selection schemes to reduce the undesired effects of interference.
