title: Generating UI Layout Code from Design Elements using a Seq2Seq Network
type: project
---

While delivering interactive and stunning experiences, implementing a design drawn by a user interface designer is one of the unexciting, repetitive and time-consuming tasks that a developer must need to accomplish before diving into more fun parts of the app development. In this project, we show that this time-consuming task of writing layout code for user interfaces can be automated to some extent by leveraging deep learning methods.
