title: Development of Personal Daily Life Stress Models Based on Laboratory Settings
type: project
---

Stress became a top issue that a ects individuals' life quality. It not only a ects the individual's life but the whole society. Due the span of this problem, stress has been a subject to many research. Such research studies aim to detect stress in daily life and try to reduce the stress level.


Recently, wearable devices such as wristbands and smart watches became popular among individuals and the sensors in these devices can be used as unobtrusive detectors of stress. The focus of our work is to improve the stress detection methods, not only using daily data collected from the wearable devices but also grounding it with physiological data, by conducting experiments in controlled rooms and using these data later on with the data collected from the wearable devices. In turn, we used the collected data to develop some models in which the stress level is predicted.
