title: Mobile Test Automation Web Framework
type: project
---

My mobile test automation web framework project is a web application where mobile developers can test their mobile applications and detect crashes. They can get detailed reports about those crashes, run generated and custom tests and interact with the device their application is being tested on in real time. I am using technologies like React, NodeJS MongoDB and Heroku to create this project.
