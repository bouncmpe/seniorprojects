type: project
---

Agile development is becoming more and more popular in software development teams. And user stories are an essential part of agile. It helps teams to focus on impact on user. A user story defines a feature from the perspective of the end user. It specifies who is the user, what is the feature, and optionally, what is the benefit of this feature.  

 A good example of a user story is: "As an Admin, I want to review posts before they are published so that I can make sure it is complicit with our rules.". Turkish teams often struggle with the correct use of user stories because there is no widely accepted rules or a tool to check the user stories against them. This project had aimed to create a web based tool for checking the quality of user stories in Turkish.  

 Thus, enforcing a common set of requirements for user stories, in teams that use it. This tool has a front-end editor for using writing user stories in the site and checking them. Users can also upload TXT or CSV files, and then download the assessment file with the same format that contains the original user stories, and, if there is any, warnings and errors.
