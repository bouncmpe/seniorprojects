title: Call Center Call Prediction in Internet Service Provider
type: project
---

We propose to develop a machine learning system which can predict which home users of an Internet Service Provider will call to within one week. Training data for the system will be provided via per-minute data gathered from modems by the Lifemote, labeled both manually and by the ISP call center via the Lifemote user interface. Roughly 3 percent of users call their ISP to complain each month. The goal of the project is identify the 10 percent of the population most likely to call with a false negative rate of less than 20 percent.
