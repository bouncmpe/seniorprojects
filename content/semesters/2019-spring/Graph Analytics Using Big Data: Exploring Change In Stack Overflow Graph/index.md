title: 'Graph Analytics Using Big Data: Exploring Change In Stack Overflow Graph'
type: project
---

The amount of data being collected and stored is vast and rapidly expanding. The term Big Data refers to the collection of all this data and our ability to use it in our advantage. Big Data Analytics aims to extract meaning from this huge amount of data. In this project, we are using “Change Exploration” to harvest information from Stack Overflow’s big graph, and its rapidly changing nature. Stack Overflow is where the heart of the software development is beating, and we seek for the answers to some simple, and some enlightening questions; along with their relations with each other to shed light to the future of programming. Throughout this journey, we have monitored changes in Stack Overflow’s data over the years and plotted the results of our investigation.
