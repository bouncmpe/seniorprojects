title: Designing an Autonomous Car Using a Simulation
type: project
---

Self-driving vehicles are one of the most awaited technology of the last century. After the developments in the field of artificial intelligence, the idea of fully autonomous cars are seemed more possible. In this project, our aim was training a model by using deep learning techniques that can drive a car on different roads. We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) due to its pattern recognition and feature extraction capabilities. At the end of the project, our trained model can successfully generalize its knowledge and navigates a car on a completely unknown road.
