title: Modelling and Simulating Cellular Automata
type: project
---

Cellular automata (CA) consists of a simple and well-formalized model of massively parallel computing, known to be capable of universal computing. CA has richÂ information processing capabilities because of their parallel behaviour; however, defining their power limitations is not easy. It is a useful approach to classifying the computational capacity of CA to examine their complexity classes.


There are many fundamental open problems with cellular automata. For example:  

 1 Is the RPCA language class closed (concatenation) under reversal?  

 2 Is LPCA stronger than RPCA?  

 3 Is PCA more powerful than LPCA?  

 In this paper I explained the questions and explained what has been done so far.
