The new FPV (First-Person View) drones can be controlled from Android / IOS phones through WiFi communication. These drones can provide Real-Time Video Streaming. In order to process this video streaming, drones should be connected directly to a computer. Both the video streaming and action commands are being sent via UDP/TCP.  

 So, that packages could be monitored. In this project, we propose an Autonomous Mini Drone Controller by using these monitored package information.
