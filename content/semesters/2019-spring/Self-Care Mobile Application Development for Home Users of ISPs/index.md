title: Self-Care Mobile Application Development for Home Users of ISPs
type: project
---

We propose to develop a user self-care application for home users of Internet Service Providers. An iOS application on the home users mobile phone will communicate with the Lifemote backend to receive a series of hypotheses, which were originally formed by per-minute data collection from the modem.  

 The app will then validate hypotheses by asking the user a minimum number of questions, arriving at the most likely solution via the least user interaction. The challenge is to design and implement a user interaction system that can combine data from the mobile device, user interaction, and data collector backend without taking unnecessary time from the user.
