title: Scheduler for the Multi User MAC Framework for IEEE 802.11ax
type: project
---

A new WiFi standard, namely IEEE 802.11ax, is being developed to improve performance in dense environments and outdoors. In 802.11ax, a scheduling access method is added to the existing random access method. The aim of this project was to develop a scheduler for IEEE 802.11ax. However, the ns-3 network simulator does not support Multi-User MAC and other features of IEEE 802.11ax currently. Instead, I tested IEEE 802.11ax with different scenarios using ns-3 and Cisco's 802.11ax addon.
