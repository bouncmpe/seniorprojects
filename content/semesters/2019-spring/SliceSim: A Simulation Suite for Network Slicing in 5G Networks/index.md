title: 'SliceSim: A Simulation Suite for Network Slicing in 5G Networks'
type: project
---

5G widely defines network slicing concept which aims to provide different and separate dedicated logical networks that can be customized to respective services. All slices under a cloud infrastructure are put together with their different requirements, e.g. bandwidth, latency. The purpose of this project is to provide a simulation suite for a network consisting of base stations and clients that possible scenarios of 5G can fit into and make analysis of different concepts easier.
