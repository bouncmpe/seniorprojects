POSeidon is an easy-to-use sales management application that targets small/medium businesses. It stores all the information in its NoSQL database. In addition, its interface is user-friendly and configurable. It allows enterprises to manage their product stock by adding products into the system and controlling products via related statistics with graphs and tables using the dashboard. On the other hand, they can add customers to store and analyse customers' statistics with confidentiality rules. The statistics are available in different formats such as monthly, yearly, product-based, customer-based, and supplier-based. Consequently, POSeidon makes it easier for the enterprises to analyze their sales and investigate their logs.
