We have developed a system which integrates IoT data market with Blockchain. The system allows IoT data producers to sell their IoT data such as pressure and light sensor data from Android devices in the Blockchain network and ML service providers will be able to access the IoT data in a decentralized way. We have used solidity language for our my smart contract and React for the development of front-end service. IoT data is being stored in a decentralized way using Swarm. We have developed an external server that process asymmetric encryption using python and used its API to perform asymmetric encryption-decryption processes.
