title: Web-based visualization of User Stories
type: project
---

User stories are widely used in agile development settings to capture the needs of several stakeholders. User stories are convenient to create due to low learning curve yet it is difficult to grasp an overview by just looking at a list of user stories. This project aims at using visualization techniques to provide an overview of a set of user stories.


This project involves:


- Identifying meaningful views of user stories


- Defining visual syntax for the aforementioned views


- Building a web-based tool to automatically create the visualizations
