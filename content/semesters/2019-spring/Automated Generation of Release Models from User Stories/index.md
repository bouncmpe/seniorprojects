title: Automated Generation of Release Models from User Stories
type: project
---

In Agile Software Engineering, working software is valued over comprehensive documentation. Currently, practitioners of agile development practices often misinterpret this as ‘no documentation’. Consequently, user stories are almost the only kind of requirements documentation maintained in the application of agile development methods.


User stories are widely used to capture the needs of stakeholders in agile development project due to their convenience. However, they lack the structure of goal models. This project aims to automatically generate goal models from a set of user stories.


This project involves extracting requirements from user stories, establishing the parent-child relations among requirements, determining the AND/OR refinement types, and understanding other relations among requirements (temporal, conflict, contribution).
