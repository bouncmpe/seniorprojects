title: Identifying Common Pathogenesis of Diseases Using Literature Mined Gene Interactions
type: project
---

There are some neurologic related diseases that might be seen in the same person and whether there are comman factors that lead to the situation or not has been the subject of interest in biomedical science. Here, by using text mining with articles, our aim is to propose a connection between diseases in gene base. In this project, spesifically, we focussed on the connection between Autism Spectrum Disorder & Epilepsy Disorder and derivatives because they often occur together. We have used PubMed to retrieve related articles and created gene-gene graphs with them. We considered two di erent approaches, one is disease weighting, the other is PageRank algorithm. We have proposed probable genes according to the appropaches. We have evaluated them with a leading expert doctor and took positive feedbacks about results. Later, the project can be adapted to other disease to disease connections.
