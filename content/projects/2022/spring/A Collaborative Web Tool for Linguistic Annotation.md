A Web Application for Annotating Dependency Parse Treebanks BoAT (Bogazici University Annotation Tool) [1] is an open-source annotation desktop tool designed for manual annotation of sentences in dependency parse format. It has been developed in the scope of a TÜBİTAK project and was implemented in Python 3. It is used by annotators in several projects to annotate the Turkish treebanks in the UD (Universal Dependencies) framework [2].
