##### **Instructions for 491/492 Project Selection and Registration**

1. Read project descriptions posted by CmpE project advisors, discuss projects you are interested in with project advisors and decide on a project.

2. Note that your GPA must be over 2.00 to register for a 491 project.
    
3. Fill the registration form and get the approval of your project advisor.
    
4. Return the registration form, approved by your project advisor, to the CmpE 491/492 coordinator before the registration period ends.

5. Enroll to CmpE 491/492 through the Registration system.
    
6. Repeat the above steps, if you want to make a change in your project selection.

##### **Project Selection**

1. CmpE seniors should read project descriptions posted by CmpE project advisors (on the department website and/or possibly somewhere near the offices of project advisors), discuss projects they are interested in with project advisors, decide on a project and then complete the project registration process as described in the "CmpE 491 and CmpE 492 Registration Form", which can be obtained from the department secretariat, or the Cmpe 492 webpage.

2. CmpE 491 is offered to students with 2.00 GPA or greater, who are interested in carrying out a much more complex project. CmpE 491 projects will continue in the following semester as CmpE 492 projects, therefore switching to another CmpE 492 project will not be allowed. Such complicated and long projects will be announced by the interested faculty separately. Note that CmpE 491 counts as one CmpE complementary course.

##### **Grading**

CmpE 491 and CmpE 492 grades are based on the following properties of your work:

- Midterm Progress Report,
- Quality of your project work,
- Participation in the Poster Session

##### **Midterm Progress Reports**

1. Each CmpE 491 and CmpE 492 project student should prepare a midterm progress report and submit it to the project advisor (and an electronic copy to the 491/492 coordinator) on or before the deadline announced for that semester.

2. Midterm progress reports should include a description of the project and reflect the part of the work done until the report deadline. Midterm progress reports should be in a format similar to the project final report, but less comprehensive in content.
Project Final Reports :

1. All project final reports are due on the date of the Poster Session. At least two copies of the final report should be submitted to the project advisor, one copy for the project advisor, and one copy for the departmental repository. Both copies should be at least spiral bound (or better). A student may get I (Incomplete and automatically F later) grade if he/she does not submit the departmental copy and return all materials that were borrowed from the project advisor.

2. The template to be used to write the midterm and final project reports is available [here](https://cloud.boun.edu.tr/public.php?service=files&t=feec4db0199af08ae102460a174b0295).

##### **Poster Session**

Students (of both 491 and 492) will present their work to other students, department faculty, and anyone else who is interested, in a Poster Session to be held immediately after the completion of the final exams. Depending on the number of students, the Poster Session may take more than one day, and you may need to reserve a slot beforehand. For the poster session, the student is expected to prepare a poster summarizing the work, describing the techniques used, the experiments conducted and the conclusions. The students are expected to give poster presentations and when applicable, do real-time demonstrations, during the allocated time slot. A jury of faculty and teaching assistants listens to all presentations and selects the best three projects. Awards are given to the selected projects and these are announced on the department website.
